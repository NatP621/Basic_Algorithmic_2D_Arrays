# Basic_algorithmic_programming_2D_arrays

Intro to OOP

This assignment introduces the design and implementation of algorithms on 2D arrays (aka images). 
The main task in this assignment is to implement  a set of “image processing” algorithms over 2D arrays representing an image, a maze, or simple 2D matrix. 
Moreover, in this assignment you are required to implement a JUnit class - to test all your functions.
